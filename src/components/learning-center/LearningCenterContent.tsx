                <AccordionTrigger>What factors impact my credit score the most?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  The most significant factors affecting your credit score are payment history (35%), credit utilization (30%), length of credit history (15%), new credit inquiries (10%), and credit mix (10%). Making on-time payments and keeping your credit utilization ratio below 30% will have the biggest positive impact.

              <AccordionItem value="item-2">
                <AccordionTrigger>How can I maximize credit card rewards?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  To maximize rewards, choose cards that align with your spending patterns, use category bonuses strategically, pay attention to rotating categories, take advantage of shopping portals, and use welcome bonuses. Always pay your balance in full to avoid interest charges that would negate the value of rewards.

              <AccordionItem value="item-3">
                <AccordionTrigger>How many credit cards should I have?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  The ideal number of credit cards varies based on your financial situation and ability to manage accounts. Having 2-5 cards is generally considered reasonable for most people. More important than the number is using them responsibly, keeping utilization low, and paying on time.

              <AccordionItem value="item-4">
                <AccordionTrigger>Will closing unused credit cards help my credit score?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  Generally, closing unused credit cards can hurt your credit score in two ways: it reduces your overall available credit (potentially increasing utilization ratio) and it may shorten your average credit history length. Unless the card has an annual fee, it's often better to keep it open and use it occasionally.

              <AccordionItem value="item-5">
                <AccordionTrigger>What's the best strategy for paying off credit card debt?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  The two most effective strategies are the avalanche method (paying off highest interest rate debt first) and the snowball method (paying off smallest balances first). The avalanche method saves the most money, while the snowball method can provide psychological wins. Consider balance transfer cards with 0% intro APR offers to reduce interest during repayment.
